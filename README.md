## Overview

### The challenge
A responsive recipe website where a list of recipes is displayed when the search text is entered or the submit button is clicked. The results can also be filtered by cuisine using a dropdown menu.

### Getting Started

First, install node modules:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
```

Second, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open the URL in your terminal with your browser to see the result.


## My process


### Built with 
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - JS framework
- [Spoonacular](https://spoonacular.com/food-api/docs) - Data source for the app
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned
- building applications with ReactJS, TailwindCSS.
- fetching web APIs and displaying their data on the UI.
- building custom Tailwind styles.
- deploying a non-static web page to GitHub Pages; encountered a minor error and will update this with the URL once resolved (https://melawlah.github.io/recipe-website/).

### Useful resources
- [Tailwind Official Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/) - The official Tailwind documentation was helpful for writing the proper syntax.
